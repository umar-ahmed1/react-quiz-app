A Trivia game that based off a user-selected topic, generates a 5 question quiz.   
This is my first official React project that was made from scratch. This was a very fun project and I learned a lot while working on it.

Skills demonstrated:  
-React (states, effects, components, conditional rendering)  
-JSX  
-JavaScript (ES6, functions)  
-CSS/HTML (Flexbox, grid)  
-API calls

The idea for the project is credited to: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8 (freeCodeCamp.org)  
The API used for the trivia questions database: https://opentdb.com/api_config.php  

This project is open-source so anyone can view the code and edit it. Here are some possible improvements to be made:  
-Display the user's best score (overall or for each topic)  
-Allow the user to select how many questions they want and the difficulty of questions  
-Store the users previous results in localStorage and display on click of a button
