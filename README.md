A Trivia game that will ask the user to select a topic and then generates a 5 question quiz based on that topic. 
This is my first official React project that was made from scratch. This was a very fun project and I learned a lot while working on it.

Skills demonstrated:
-React (states, effects, components, conditional rendering)
-JSX
-JavaScript (ES6, functions)
-CSS/HTML (Flexbox, grid)
-API calls
